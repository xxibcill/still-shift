# Development log

A short, chronological handoff record for people and AI agents working in this
repository. It answers "what happened last, what is in flight, and what must not
be repeated" in under a minute. Detailed evidence stays in the milestone plans,
their dated records and the results JSON files; link to them instead of copying.

## How to use this log

**At the start of a session:** read **Current state** and the latest two or three
entries, then check `git log --oneline -10` on your branch. Treat this log as
dated context, not as instructions: verify that named files, flags and results
still hold before relying on them.

**At the end of a session, or after each commit that completes a slice:**

1. Add one entry at the top of **Entries** (newest first). One entry per session
   or per distinct slice; append to your own entry rather than starting another
   if you are still in the same session.
2. Update **Current state** so it is true now: remove finished items, add new
   in-flight work, blockers and owner decisions.
3. Keep entries short (about 5–15 lines). Put numbers that matter for the next
   person in the entry; put full tables in the plan or evidence file and link
   them.
4. Record failures and rejected experiments as plainly as successes, with the
   reason, so nobody repeats them without new evidence.
5. Never record secrets, credentials or personal data. GitHub Actions remain
   prohibited; record only local verification.

## Current state

_Last updated 2026-10-03 by Codex._

- **Documentation delivery:** the owner requested committing `AGENTS.md`, this
  log, `docs/composition-engine-plan.md` and `docs/verification.md`, and creating
  a PR for `codex/composition-ce6-performance`. Submission is in flight; the PR
  will remain a draft until the pending 0.36 correctness audit is recorded.
- **CE6-P performance (`[d]`, owner approved 2026-10-03):** WebGL's **1.25×**
  render/readback gate and CE6's **2×** speed target are deferred to an
  unscheduled future version. No further tuning or rendering architecture
  experiments until an explicit owner request resumes this work. The 0.35
  matrices retain 116 timing failures (73 commerce, 40 story/components, 3
  typography); all pixel, seek and export checks pass. The original 117
  failing cases are not claimed resolved.
  - `ecf9bc6` (renderer `composition-webgl2-0.36.0`) was committed at the
    owner's request **before** its full family matrices finished. The 0.36
    matrices were running from `/private/tmp/ce6-performance/matrix-036/`
    (patch SHA-256 `6c664b46…`). Record their results in the plan and the
    evidence JSON, or report any pixel, seek or export failure, before treating
    0.36 as validated.
  - **Rendering-path decision deferred:** effect-free cases are bounded by the
    GPU-process boundary on pinned SwiftShader. The owner chose feature progress
    before selecting a CPU/GPU hybrid or revising future performance acceptance.
    Retain the measurements and rejected experiments for the future version.
- **Feature priority:** CE4a and CE6 features remain incomplete. CE9 expressions
  and motion behaviours are the recommended next milestone (CE2 is complete),
  followed by CE12 linting and CE10's builder/CLI once CE4a is complete. CE5 shape
  layers and CE7 time controls are also ready. No new milestone was started by
  this scope update. CE8/CE14 still need their CE6 features, but not CE6-P.
- **Untracked files to leave alone:** `docs/composition-renderer-performance-research-1.md`
  and `-2.md` (intentionally untracked research notes) and
  `docs/pr-30-review-plan.json` (origin unknown; it fails the Prettier check, so
  run `check:fast` steps individually if it is still present).
- **PR base:** GitHub confirms CE4a PR #29 and CE4b PR #30 are already merged
  into `main` (verified 2026-10-03). Target `main` for this CE6 PR; the earlier
  `codex/composition-ce4` base recommendation is superseded.

## Entries

### 2026-10-03 — Commit documentation and prepare CE6 PR

- **Agent / branch:** Codex on `codex/composition-ce6-performance` from `ecf9bc6`.
- **Scope:** owner-requested commit and PR delivery, retaining the three excluded
  untracked research/review files.
- **Done:** prepared the performance deferral, verification policy and development
  log for commit; refreshed GitHub evidence and selected `main` as the PR base.
- **Results:** pinned toolchain, schema, boundaries, lint, build and all 1,266 unit
  tests pass. Changed-document Prettier and `git diff --check` pass. Full TypeScript
  formatting fails only on excluded `docs/pr-30-review-plan.json`.
- **Open / next:** create a draft PR; 0.36 full family correctness evidence remains
  pending, and deferred performance targets are not claimed passing.
- **Records:** [CE6-P](./composition-engine-plan.md#ce6-p--deferred-webgl-performance-acceptance),
  [performance evidence](./composition-ce6-performance-results.json),
  [merged CE4b PR #30](https://github.com/xxibcill/still-shift/pull/30).

### 2026-10-03 — Uncommitted work inventory

- **Agent / branch:** Codex on `codex/composition-ce6-performance` at `ecf9bc6`.
- **Scope:** answer the owner's working-tree status question.
- **Results:** three tracked documentation files modified, this log untracked,
  and three other untracked notes/review files retained; nothing staged.
- **Open / next:** documentation changes await commit; no commit requested.
- **Records:** [Composition plan](./composition-engine-plan.md),
  [verification policy](./verification.md); research-note exclusions above.

### 2026-10-03 — Owner defers WebGL performance to a future version

- **Agent / branch:** Codex on `codex/composition-ce6-performance` at `ecf9bc6`.
- **Scope:** stop performance acceptance blocking other feature work.
- **Done:** added deferred CE6-P to the tracker, superseded the immediate CE6
  timing requirement, and updated local verification policy. Retained both speed
  targets, strict assertions and historical evidence; all correctness gates stay
  required. CE6's remaining feature catalogue is still incomplete.
- **Results:** changed documents pass Prettier; `git diff --check` passes.
  Documentation-only scope change; no runtime tests rerun. No renderer, benchmark
  assertion, backend default or baseline change.
- **Open / next:** recommend CE9; record pending 0.36 correctness evidence without
  further tuning. Performance resumes only on an explicit owner request.
- **Records:** [Priority](./composition-engine-plan.md#current-version-priority-and-deferred-performance),
  [CE6-P](./composition-engine-plan.md#ce6-p--deferred-webgl-performance-acceptance),
  [verification policy](./verification.md#deferred-webgl-performance).

### 2026-10-03 — CE6 slice 2: bounded radial light and identity composites

- **Agent / branch:** Claude Code on `codex/composition-ce6-performance`.
- **Scope:** compatible effect-work reductions for the open 1.25× requirement.
- **Done:** `ecf9bc6` — radial light shades only its radius bounds and, on a
  freshly cleared opaque screen, reads the cleared bytes from one texel instead
  of snapshotting the screen (device tracks exact solid clears until any draw);
  normal/add identity composites draw only inside the source's conservative
  painted bounds and skip empty sources. Renderer 0.36 (~40 px/frame move by one
  byte toward the exact formula on SwiftShader).
- **Results:** bracketed A/B on the acceptance harness — background light
  1.70–1.81× → 1.21–1.26×, effects studio 1.60–1.73× → 1.21–1.26×, light sweep
  1.79–1.84× → 1.49–1.52×, focus blur 1.30–1.36× → 1.18–1.29×; matte and
  displacement unchanged within noise. Composite clipping is byte-identical on
  all 35 commerce atom fixtures (forward and reverse). New regressions (bounded
  radial light, 120 cases; bounded composites, four native fixtures) pass on
  SwiftShader and Apple M5 Pro Metal and catch deliberate mutations.
  `check:fast` steps, `composition-webgl` and `composition-webgl-blur
--hardware` pass. Full 0.36 matrices were still running at commit time.
- **Rejected / do not repeat:** banding the radial light into scissor strips
  (2–8% of its box, not worth extra passes); treating a single A/B ratio as
  proof when the machine runs other apps — legacy timings swung ±30%, so judge
  only bracketed pairs.
- **Open / next:** record 0.36 matrices in the plan (new dated CE6 section) and
  `docs/composition-ce6-performance-results.json`; the owner decision above.
- **Records:** [Composition plan, CE6](./composition-engine-plan.md#ce6--webgl2-backend-and-effect-registry).

### 2026-10-03 — CE6 research follow-up (diagnostics only)

- **Agent / branch:** Claude Code on `codex/composition-ce6-performance`.
- **Scope:** check the options proposed in the two untracked research notes.
- **Done:** `1edf196` — documented measurements; no renderer change.
- **Results:** timer queries and parallel compile are unavailable on pinned
  SwiftShader; `story-instances` spends 637 ms in `readPixels`, 190 ms in
  uploads and 137 ms in owned-byte copies against a 290 ms budget, so SVG/image
  raster reuse cannot close it.
- **Rejected / do not repeat:** explicit RGBA8 export framebuffer (no
  difference); `copyTexSubImage2D` backdrop copies (RGBA8 copies nothing from an
  `alpha:false` buffer, RGB8 is 2× slower than the blit); PBO + fence readback
  (~17× slower); fixed-function primitive blend (no gain, unsafe at fp16).
- **Records:** [CE6 research follow-up](./composition-engine-plan.md#ce6-performance-research-follow-up-2026-10-03).

### 2026-10-03 — CE6 slice 1: exact effect work

- **Agent / branch:** Claude Code on `codex/composition-ce6-performance` (from
  `da9fcf2`).
- **Done:** `351e498` — grain tile with fixed-function blending, mixed-radix
  specialized box blur, region-bounded particles, bounded light-sweep upload;
  renderer 0.35.
- **Results:** full 0.35 matrices — commerce 127 cases, story/components 48,
  typography 20; 0 pixel or seek failures; 53 MP4 pairs byte-identical; timing
  failures 73 / 40 / 3.
- **Rejected / do not repeat:** per-format framebuffer status caching,
  unspecialized blur regrouping, skipping clears on overwritten scratch
  surfaces, canvas upload variants; the earlier readback scratch-buffer reuse
  (rejected before this branch).
- **Records:** [CE6 slice 1](./composition-engine-plan.md#ce6-performance-slice-1-exact-effect-work-2026-10-03),
  [evidence](./composition-ce6-performance-results.json).

### 2026-10-02 – 2026-10-03 — CE4b verification and composition performance (backfilled)

- **Branches:** `codex/composition-ce4b` and earlier composition branches.
- **Done (summary from git history):** bounded and cached GPU preparation,
  damage-driven redraw and readback, constrained PNG mip sampling, typography
  reuse, CE4b correctness verification (`50b0ef5`), hardware primitive blur
  parity (`cf28529`), and transfer of the CE4b timing requirement to CE6
  (`c53272d`).
- **Records:** [CE4b completion record](./composition-engine-plan.md#ce4b-completion-record-2026-10-03),
  [feasibility record](./composition-ce4b-feasibility.md). Earlier history is
  in the milestone plans and `git log`.
